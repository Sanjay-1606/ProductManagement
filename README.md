# 🛠️ Internal Product Management Tool for eCommerce

This tool is designed for internal users (e.g., merchandisers, category managers) to manage dynamic product catalogs for an eCommerce platform. It supports custom attributes per category and ensures scalability as new product categories are added over time.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The eCommerce platform currently sells products like **dresses** and **shoes**, and is expanding to new categories every 6 months (e.g., **watches**, **smartphones**, **grooming products**, **accessories**).

Each product category has unique attributes, for example:

- **Smartphones** → OS, RAM, Battery Size  
- **Watches** → Dial Color, Dial Size, Strap Type

The tool must:

- Allow creation of new categories and their custom attributes  
- Enable product creation and editing with category-specific attributes  
- Ensure data integrity and scalability

---

## ✅ Features

- 🗂 Define and manage dynamic product categories  
- ⚙️ Assign custom attributes to each category  
- 🛒 Create, update, and manage products with flexible attributes  
- 🔒 Ensure data consistency and scalability for future categories
